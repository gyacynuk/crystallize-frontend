LunarDocs is a web-based text editor developed by Griffin Yacynuk. The project aims to provide users with an integrated note-taking and study environment: specifically users can annotate their notes with flash-card style questions, which they will later quiz themselves with. Please note that this project is currently a **work in progress**.
